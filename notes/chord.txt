chord:
    required, no default value 

wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_notation

chord names indicate the following:
    1) root note 
    2) chord quality 
    3) chord extension
    4) altered notes 
    5) added tones 
    6) modified bass note (slash chord) 

eg: Cmaj9b5(add11)/D 

validation
    root: 
        any valid tone A through G followed optionally by 
        a sharp or flat symbol indicated by a hashtag or 
        lowercase b respectively, allowing for oddities such
        as Cb and E# 

    chord quality:
        one of the following:   
            - [nothing]/M 
            - minor/m 
            - diminished/dim 
            - aug/+
            - sus
        lacking any simple or quickly accessible notation for half 
        diminished chords, they can be notated as m7b5

    chord extensions: 
        either maj/min followed by any of the following numbers:
            2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13 
        for options 2 and 4, the chord quality needs to be specified as 
        'sus'. if 'sus' is specified and no number is provided, default 
        to a sus4 voicing. 
        for 5/power chords, it is necessary to validate that a chord
        quality has not been specified
        when no chord quality is specified, this value needs to be 
        6 or greater. if 6, the chord is a major 6th. any higher 
        and it is dominant. logic could be straightforward here, simply 
        flattening the 7th for any chord not specifying a quality. 
        how would a chord like EmMaj9 work? 

    altered tones: 
        allow the user to alter any odd-numbered scale degree 
        from 5 to 13. specifically:
            - 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 
        should be indicated with the same sharp and flat symbols 
        used for the root. the tone being altered needs to be 
        present in the chord.

    added tones: 
        allow the user to add additional notes to the chord. 
        below the octave, this could be any tone not present 
        in the chord. above the octave, this should only be 
        odd numbers with optional flat or sharp indications 

    modified bass note: 
        indicated by a forward slash followed by some valid 
        tone indicator. a letter from A to G followed optionally 
        by a sharp or flat symbol. 


revelation:

chord quality should only concern notes that directly affect the 
base triad of the chord. 
extensions don't need to know anything about the previous notes in 
the chord. extensions are entirely self-contained 

extension note count formula:
    ((n%7)/2)+1
    7%7 = 0, 0/2 = 0, 0 + 1 = 1
    9%7 = 2, 2/2 = 1, 1 + 1 = 2 
   11%7 = 4, 4/2 = 2, 2 + 1 = 3 
   13%7 = 6, 6/2 = 3, 3 + 1 = 4
